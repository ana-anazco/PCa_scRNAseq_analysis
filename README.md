# scRNA-seq analysis in murine prostate cancer samples
This repository will contain all scripts and code used for the single-cell RNA sequencing analyses presented in the doctoral thesis:

"Unraveling RNA modification dynamics in prostate cancer progression at single-cell resolution"

Author: Ana AÃ±azco
Institution: CIC (University of Salamanca - CSIC)
Year: 2025

The analyses include:

-Preprocessing and quality control
-Cell type annotation
-Cell-cell interaction analysis
-Gene ontology enrichment
-Pseudotime inference
-Gene regulatory network analysis

All scripts will be uploaded soon to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of the results reported in the thesis.
